# How SAT is scored-(Ehtesham)

# check the code in the Joining the three datasets section to make sure that 
 # we have the nessesary variables + any accuracy issues (Ehtesham)

# add the survey response columns from all_joined to df dataframe (laknath)

# make characrter columns numeric that have SAT scores and percentage (Abinav)

# Based on the real data deternime how we combine scores/or whether to keep seperate (Abhinav)
  # should include histogram also boxplot (abhinav)

# see if there is difference in aveage scores between just high scool vs those other types
  # see if tere is difference between male and female (Ehtesham)


# correlation plot (multi coleniarity) -Raj
    # also include the numbers -Raj

# plot histogram of (distribution) of SAT scores -Raj/Kushboo

```  



# Determine if there is a relationship between enrollment and SAT scores-scatterplot (Laknath)

```
It looks like there is a positve linear association between enrollment and SAT reading scores
